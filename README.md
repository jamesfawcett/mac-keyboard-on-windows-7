Mac Keyboard on Windows 7 with Mac style shortcuts
==================================================


Use your Mac keyboard on a Windows machine, but keep the mac key's layout. For example, CMD & C becomes copy, instead of CTRL & C. Very useful if you are familiar with working with a Mac layout. Download autohotkey to run, I have included a compiled version for those without http://www.autohotkey.com/

Tested on Windows 7 and used daily.

Installation
------------

- Install Autohotkey on your PC
- Run mackeys.ahk
- Create a shortcut to mackeys.ahk in your Windows startup folder.
